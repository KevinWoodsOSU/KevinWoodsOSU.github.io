			<h2>The DOM</h2>
		</div>
		<p id="intropara">Now that we know how to make an API request and filter our results, we can start the journey of creating a website by pulling
		information from Petfinder into the DOM. DOM stands for <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp">Document Object Model</a>. When a webpage is loaded,
		the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page where it defines HTML elements as objects and defines the properties, methods, and events of all elements.
		This allows us to access the DOM using JavaScript and to create dynamic web pages that can interact with users. For example, we can create a button that when pressed by
		the user will change text to red.

	<h2 id="header2">jQuery Syntax</h2>
	<p id="textcontent">Let's start by implementing a button to change some text to red. Again we are using jQuery, but this time we will go over the the code in more detail.
	</p>
	<div id="content">
	<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/Kwoods/1g6c3uzy/4/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
	</div>
	<p id="textcontent">jQuery syntax is designed for simplicity. All it needs to know is which HTML element to perform some action on
		in the form: <strong>$(selector).action()</strong>. This gives us the option to manipulate HTML code dynamically, based on incoming information 
		or user triggered events, while the webpage is live.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>$(selector)</strong> accesses the desired HTML elements. Some of the selector syntax is shown below:
			<ul>
				<li class="subList"><strong>$(this)</strong>: selects the current element</li>
				<li class="subList"><strong>$("div")</strong>: selects all div elements</li>
				<li class="subList"><strong>$(".text")</strong>: selects all elements with class = "text"</li>
				<li class="subList"><strong>$("#text")</strong>: selects all elements with id = "text"</li>
			</ul>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>.action()</strong> represents some sort of event, like a button click, which performs an action, like changing text color. 
			More event examples can be found at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_events.asp">w3schools</a>.
	</ul>
	<h2 id="header2">Building a Website</h2>
	<p id="textcontent">We are now going to use information from an API request to populate our webpage with images and information. We will start with a simple example using 
	JSON data of three animals pulled from our API request on the <a href="apiRequest.html">previous page</a>. Unfortunately we cannot make the API call using JSFiddle because 
	Petfinder's url uses <code>http://</code> while JSFiddle uses <code>https://</code> and considers Petfinder to be unsecure. Instead, I've just copied the JSON data using 
	<code>JSON.stringify()</code> and created an array of three objects containing data for three different animals.
	</p>
		<div id="content">
			<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/Kwoods/mc1quL1p/3/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</div>
	<p id="textcontent">If you are building a website with Petfinder's API, you most likely want to share photos of the aniamls. We've started with just that. Using jQuery, we have
		pulled one photo of each of our three animals contained in the <code>petData</code> array of objects. Animals may have more than one photo, and each photo is presented in different sizes. 
		Let's take a look at the code and see how we used jQuery and the DOM to make this happen. 
		</p>
		
	<ul>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>$(document).ready(function()</strong>: The selector select the entire HTML document and calls the <code>ready()</code> method. This waits until the DOM has been loaded and
			is safe to work with. This allows us to declare variables after our functions since they will be present in the DOM while our scripts execute.<li>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>$.each(petData, function(key, value)</strong>: This is a shorthand for loop that says, "For each element in the <code>petData</code> array, perform some function. 
			So every time this loops, we will do something to with an object returned from Petfinder.<li>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>var picture = value.petfinder.pet.media.photos.photo[3].$t</strong>: Here we store the link to one of the photos belonging to an animal.<li>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>$("#appendhere").append('&ltli&gt&ltimg src="' + picture + '" /&gt&lt/li&gt')</strong>: In our HTML code we have an unordered list element with the id "appendhere". We select this 
			element with the selector and add the text <code>&ltli&gt&ltimg src="' + picture + '" /&gt&lt/li&gt </code> as a child element to the unordered list. This creates a list element that contains and image 
			whose source we've set to <code>picture</code>.<li>
	</ul>
	<p id="textcontent">Everyone loves pictures, but they're not much good on their own. Now we are going to add an event to each image. Everytime you click an image, relevant information will appear next to it.
		</p>
		<div id="content">
			<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/Kwoods/kn9nkfcd/7/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</div>
	<ul>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>$("#appendhere").append('&ltli&gt&ltimg src="' + picture + '" id="pic' + key + '" /&gt&lt/li&gt')</strong>: This is similar to what we had before, except this time we've added an 
			ID - <code>id="pic" + key</code>. A unique ID is generated for each image because <code>key</code> is the index generated by the <code>$.each</code> loop. This is important for assigning unique events to each 
			image.<li>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>$("#pic" + key).click(function()</strong>: Here we are selecting the element with the unique ID we just generated. Since we are still inside the <code>$.each</code> loop, we can continue to
			use <code>key</code> to select and create tags. For each image, we tell the DOM that when it is clicked on, some function will occur.<li>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>$("#info").empty()</strong>: The <code>empty()</code> function erases all of the text in between opening and closing element tags. This is to ensure that when we click an animal, the previous 
			animal's information is removed.<li>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>Appending Information</strong>: The rest of the code is pretty straightforward. We use the <a href="json.html">dot operator</a> on the object to extract the information we want then append 
			it do the DOM. This makes it visible to the user.<li>
	<ul>
	<p id="textcontent">Let's try adding one more potentially useful function. Say you have a very long list of potential pets and as you're looking through, you already know which ones you're not interested in. It would be helpful 
		to have some sort of a remove image function to shorten your list. 
	</p>
		<div id="content">
			<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/Kwoods/87gLcmvL/2/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</div>
	<ul>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>$("#info").append('&ltbutton id="myButton' + key + '"&gtRemove&lt/button&gt')</strong>: We've added a button element that says remove to our div with the ID "info". We've again given
			this a unique ID so it will remove the appropriate photo.<li>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>$("#myButton" + key).click(function()</strong>: Here we assign each unique button its own function that triggers when the button is clicked.<li>
		<li class="urlList"><strong>Removal</strong>: The <code>remove()</code> function is utilized here to remove both the photo and the button from the DOM. For all of the span elements created, we simply change their 
			text to <code>''</code>, effectively deleting the content.<li>
	<h2 id="header2">Conclusion</h2>
	<p id="textcontent">In this guide we've only scratched the surface of what's possible using Petfinder's API, JSON, jQuery, and the DOM. Hopefully this guide will help you through the fundamentals of working with Petfinder's API. 
		A good next step would be to try to take some form of user input, like a zip code, to filter your API request.
